## **Introduction**

> **What is Contactmation?**

Contactmation is a powerful **desktop based team management solution** that **helps its users efficiently and
effectively manage many projects and groups at once.**

Contactmation will be able to help you save all your contact details, keep track of
each projects' group and subgroup, and delegate tasks to each group.

> **Who is Contactmation for?**

Contactmation is for **project managers and supervisors** that want to maintain an organised view of their
projects and streamline the management of their projects.

#### Purpose of this guide

This guide elaborates on all the features available in Contactmation that are necessary for the purpose of Contactmation.
It also binds the features together with real examples that allows the users to gain a clearer idea of how the features 
are utilised. Some key components of Contactmation are established, in hopes of demonstrating the benefits of 
Contactmation to users.

#### How to use this guide

The [table of contents](#table-of-contents) gives a complete overview of the guide. Following it **sequentially** effectively
portrays the expected common usage of Contactmation.

---

## **About**

### What it looks like

The following figure shows the different graphical components of our application.
We will be referring to these terminologies throughout the user guide:

![Contactmation ui elements](images/ContactmationUi.png)

---

## **Prerequisites**

- Ensure that `Java 11` and above is installed on your device. If you do not have `Java 11` installed, please refer to
  this [Java 11 installation guide](https://www.codejava.net/java-se/download-and-install-java-11-openjdk-and-oracle-jdk).
- The current version of Contactmation can only be used in a desktop, but should work in all operating systems (such as 
Windows, macOS and Linux etc.) as long as `Java 11` is installed.

--- 

## **Additional Information**

### Definitions

In this user guide, we define any parameters within **square brackets** ([ ]) e.g. `[t/new_tag]` as
**optional parameters**, and commands within **angled brackets** (< >) e.g. `<command>` are **necessary parameters**.

**Ellipses** `...` indicate that more than 1 input of a certain type can be given to a single command.
For example, `[t/tags ...]` means that an optional number (0 or more) of `tags` can be added to a single
user command, but `t/tags...` means that 1 or more `tags` can be given to a single user command.

Other keywords utilised in the Guide is defined in the [Glossary](#glossary).

### Scoping

Since Contactmation is a multi group management contact application, it supports scoping to facilitate
easy access between groups and subgroups of a group project.

Scoping defines the relationship between different groups. For example, a subgroup can be contained within
another group, similar to how a folder on your desktop can be contained within another folder.

There may also be many subgroups under a group, similar to how there may be many sub folders under a folder.

Adding to the analogy, your contacts can be thought of as files on your desktop. Contacts can thus be
added to a group or a subgroup, similar to how files can be added into folders.

---

## **Quick start**

1. Ensure that the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) are met before installing Contactmation.

2. Download the latest version of `contactmation.jar` from
   [here](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/releases).

3. Save `contactmation.jar` into a Desktop folder on your computer. This folder will now be the home folder
   for Contactmation.

4. Double-click on `contactmation.jar` to start up the application. You will be greeted with the current window
   if everything goes well:

![Contactmation ui main window](images/ContactmationUiClean.png)

> **Note:** If you wish to clear all default entries, use the [clear](#clear-command-clear) command.


5. You may begin by referring to the [basic features](#basic-features) section to get started on using
   Contactmation. For additional, more powerful commands, refer to our [advanced features](#advanced-features),
   especially if you are comfortable with the CLI or have prior programming experience.

---

## **Features**

With Contactmation, you can not only use the **basic features** to manage your group project, but also use 
**advanced features** to customise your experience to fit your personal needs.

## Basic features

Now that you have finished setting up Contactmation, let’s start performing basic tasks with Contactmation.
As Contactmation aims to help you manage your contacts, project groups and tasks, we will start off by performing
a range of basic commands varying from adding a person to manipulating tasks and teams.

The basic features are categorised as the following:
1. General Commands
2. Contact Commands
3. Team Commands
4. Task Commands

## Contact commands

### Constraints on contact information

The following contact commands comply with these placeholder constraints:

- The `NAME` of the contact must be alphanumeric and can contain whitespace.
- The `PHONE_NUMBER` of the contact must be at least 3 digits long.
- The `EMAIL` of the contact must be in the format `local-part@domain`.

  - `Local-part`: Only contain alphanumeric characters and these special characters, excluding
    the parentheses, (+\_.-). The local-part may not start or end with any special characters.
  - `Domain`:

    - Ends with a domain label at least 2 characters long.
    - Have each domain label start and end with alphanumeric characters.
    - Have each domain label consist of alphanumeric characters, separated only by hyphens, if any.

- The `ADDRESS` can take any values, but it should not be blank.
- The `TAG` must be alphanumeric.
- The `INDEX` must be a positive integer which cannot exceed the number of contacts currently displayed in the
  application.
- The `KEYWORD` and `MORE_KEYWORDS` must be alphanumeric.

### Create a Contact

Let us start off by adding a person to Contactmation. To add a contact, you can use the command `person new`, followed by the name of the person. You can also choose to provide the phone number, email and address to each person, or add a tag to identify each person.

**Format**: `person new n/<NAME> [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]...`

**Examples**:

- `person new n/Spongebob`
- `person new n/Squidward Tentacles p/01234567 e/squidward@gmail.com a/Bikini Bottom Krusty Krab t/Employee`

![Add Person Screenshot](images/user-guide-img/PersonNewScreenshot.PNG)

### Delete a contact

You can use the `person delete` command to delete a contact from the list of persons in the current scope.

**Format**: `person delete <INDEX>`

**Example**:

- `person delete 1`

### Listing all contacts

Contactmation supports the `list` command that displays all of your contacts into a list of persons.

**Format**: `list`

---

## General commands
You can use these commands used on all 3 categories of commands, namely **command**, **team**, and **task** commands.
These commands are also irrespective of the [scope](#scoping) you are in.


### Clear command: `clear`

This command clears all group, contact and task entries from the application. You can do this to commemorate the end of 
a project, and kickstart a new one.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">❗ **WARNING** <br>
THIS ACTION IS IRREVERSIBLE! RUN THIS COMMAND AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION**
</div>


**Format:** `clear`

### Find command: `find`

Searches for a contact, group or task that matches the given `KEYWORD`. Searches may also include `MORE_KEYWORDS`
to further narrow the search for a contact, subgroup or task within the current [scope](#scoping).

**Format:** `<ITEM> find <KEYWORD> [<MORE_KEYWORDS>]`

**Examples:**

- `person find John Doe`
- `task find task1 task2`
- `team find task1 task2`

### Exits the program: `exit`

Exits the current session and closes the application.

**Format:** `exit`

---

## Contact commands

Now, you should use these set of commands to add the members of your project.
The commands will allow you to add the necessary information on your members with ease as well.
Moreover, our software ensures that the information of the member you added, as a contact, is valid.
Contact-related commands precede with the `person` keyword.

#### Things to note when using contact commands

The following contact commands comply with these placeholder constraints:

- The `NAME` of the contact must be alphanumeric and can contain whitespace.
- The `PHONE_NUMBER` of the contact must be at least 3 digits long.
- The `EMAIL` of the contact must be in the format `local-part@domain`.

    - `local-part`: Only contain alphanumeric characters and these special characters, excluding
      the parentheses, (+\_.-). The local-part may not start or end with any special characters.
    - `domain`:

        - Ends with a domain label at least 2 characters long.
        - Have each domain label start and end with alphanumeric characters.
        - Have each domain label consist of alphanumeric characters, separated only by hyphens, if any.

- The `ADDRESS` can take any values, but it should not be blank.
- The `TAG` must be alphanumeric.
- The `INDEX` (the number of the person in the list) must be a positive integer which cannot exceed the number of contacts currently displayed in the
  application.
- The `KEYWORD` and `MORE_KEYWORDS` must be alphanumeric.

### Create a Contact

Let us start off by adding a person to Contactmation. To add a contact, you can use the command `person new`, followed by the name of the person. You can also choose to provide the phone number, email and address to each person, or add a tag to identify each person.

**Format**: `person new n/<NAME> [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]...`

**Examples**:

- `person new n/Spongebob`
- `person new n/Squidward Tentacles p/01234567 e/squidward@gmail.com a/Bikini Bottom Krusty Krab t/Employee`

![Add Person Screenshot](images/user-guide-img/PersonNewScreenshot.PNG)


### Delete a contact


You can use the `person delete` command to delete a contact from the list of persons in the current scope.


**Format**: `person delete <INDEX>`

**Example**:

- `person delete 1`
  - this deletes the first person on the person list shown.
  
### Listing all contacts

Contactmation supports the `list` command that displays all of your contacts into a list of persons.


**Format**: `list`

---

## Team commands

Contactmation allows you to group your contacts into teams, which allows you to issue and assign tasks to members of
specific teams. Team-related commands in Contactmation begin with the `team` keyword.


#### Things to note when using team commands

The following team commands comply with these placeholder constraints:

- The `TEAM NAME` must be alphanumeric.
- The `INDEX`(the number of the team in the list) must be a positive integer which cannot exceed the number of contacts / teams currently displayed
  in the application.

### Create a Team

Contactmation provides the `team new` command to create a new team with a specified team name.

**Format**: `team new <TEAM_NAME>`

The above command creates a new team with a specified team name. The team name should not contain any spaces, and should
consist of alphanumeric characters with hyphens or underscores only.

**Examples**:

- `team new CS1101S`
- `team new Krusty_Krab_Employees`

![Create Team Screenshot](images/user-guide-img/CreateTeamScreenshot.PNG)

### Delete a Team

To delete a team from Contactmation, you can use the `team delete` command followed with the team number as specified in
the team list.

**Format**: `team delete <INDEX>`

**Examples**:

- `team delete 1`
  The above command deletes team number 1 in the list of teams.

### Navigate to a Team

To perform commands specific to a team, you will have to navigate first to that specific team. You can use the `cg`
command to navigate to a specified team. This command updates the group scope that is currently being displayed in
the application.

This command is similar to going into a folder on your desktop, or stepping
out of it.


> **Note:**
> Please look at how [scoping](#scoping) works before continuing.

**Formats**:

- `cg <INDEX>`
- `cg ..` navigates to its parent group. This is similar to stepping out of a folder once.
- `cg /` navigates to its root group. This is similar to moving your current context to the root folder.

**Examples**:

- `cg 3`
  - The above command allows you to navigate to team number 3 in the list of teams.
  - Before:
    ![Create Team Screenshot](images/user-guide-img/NavigateTeamBeforeScreenshot.PNG)
  - After:
    ![Create Team Screenshot](images/user-guide-img/NavigateTeamAfterScreenshot.PNG)
- `cg ..`

<aside>

💡 If you are familiar with UNIX-based operating systems such as Linux or familiar with using terminal, the navigation 
command (`cg`) in Contactmation follows a similar syntax to the change directory command (`cd`).

</aside>

### Add New Contacts within a Team

Once you have navigated to a team, you can add a new contact within that team, which is done through the same command
as adding a contact to Contactmation.


**Format**: `person new n/<NAME> [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]...`

**Examples**:

- `person new n/Spongebob`
- `person new n/Squidward Tentacles p/01234567 e/squidward@gmail.com a/Bikini Bottom Krusty Krab t/Employee`

### Removing a Contact from a Team

To remove a contact from a team, first ensure that you have navigated to that specific team. Afterwards, you can remove
the person by using the `team remove` command.

**Format**: `team remove <INDEX>`

**Examples**:

- `team remove 1`
  - The above command removes person number 1 from the list of persons within the team.

### Creating and Deleting a Subteam

Contactmation allows the creation and deletion of a subteam within a team using the same command as
[creating a team](#create-a-team) and [deleting a team](#delete-a-team).


## Task commands
After adding your **contacts**, and allocating them into **teams**, you can give them **tasks**!
Task-related commands precede with the `task` keyword.

#### Things to note when using contact commands
- The `INDEX`(the number of the team in the list) must be a positive integer which cannot exceed the number of contacts / teams currently displayed
in the application.

### Adding a task to a team: `task add`

Adds a new task to an existing group scope. This group **cannot be the root group**.

![Create Team Screenshot](images/user-guide-img/TaskAddScreenshot.PNG)

**Format:** `task add t/<TITLE> d/<DESCRIPTION>`

**Example:**

- `task add t/Complete all CS2103T homework d/Give description here`

### Deleting a task from team: `task delete`

Deletes an existing task from a group by their `INDEX` within the current [scope](#scoping).

Format: `task delete <INDEX>`

Example:

- `task delete 1`
  - This command deletes the first task in the task list.

### Setting progress for tasks: `task progress`

**THIS FEATURE IS CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS**

Sets the progress level for each task that has been listed.

Format: `task progress <INDEX> <LEVEL>`

- Index indicates the index of the task in the list.
- Level indicates the progress level, and can only be set to 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%.

Example:
- `task progress 1 25%`
  - This sets the progress of the first task in the list as 25%.

## **Advanced features**

Now, there might be many things that you wish to do with managing your tasks and groups. However, it feels really,
really tedious to perform multiple functions one after the other.
Are you a power user? Are you good with logic? Well this section is for you! Supercharge your user experience by
adding and customizing your own commands and features!

Firstly, let’s understand what these commands are and how these commands work in Contactmation.

### Advanced features overview: Chaining

Most of the commands in Contactmation can take in an input and give an output. This is similar to how your functions
work in programming and mathematics.

For instance, take the command `ops`. This command can take in a value, perform some operators on it and returns
the value. Another command is the command `float`. This command allows you to create a floating point value and return
it.

Many commands in Contactmation have this functionality, and you can in turn **chain multiple commands together to
perform complicated tasks** that suits your needs.

So, how do we chain multiple commands together? We can use the `|` and `;` and the `seq` command to do so. The way
this commands work is extremely similar to how `|` and `;` works on a UNIX operating system. You can chain multiple
commands together like such:

- `seq <command 1> [| command 3]...`
- `seq <command 1> [; command 3]...`


Whenever a pipe symbol (`|`) is encountered, the output of the previous commands is then passed to the next command.

Whenever (`;`) is used, the output of the previous commands are not passed on.

All commands that produce an output supports the use of `|` to “pipe” their output to the subsequent commands.

#### Advanced feature constraints

While these advanced features can make your Contactmation experience a lot smoother, it is also subject to certain
limitations. These are the following constraints for each keyword in the format section of each advanced feature
command:

- The `MACRO WORD` is alphanumeric but hyphens and underscores are allowed. It must also begin with a letter.
- `INPUT` is a string of any length.

Here are some commands that will aid you in gaining better control over Contactmation:

### Select command

This command allows you to select a specific group, contact or task by their `INDEX`. While this command does nothing
by itself, it is useful as a precursor to chaining other commands after it.

**Format:** `<ITEM> select <INDEX> <COMMAND> [...]`

**Example:**

- `task select 3 mark`

![Select command ui](images/SelectCommandUi)

### Contains command

You can use the `contains` command which takes in an item and checks if it contains a certain attribute. If it does,
then the attribute description will be shown in the result display if there is no further piping.

**Format:** `<ITEM> contains <ATTRIBUTE>`

**Example:**

- `task select 1 contains bug`

![Contains command ui](images/ContainsCommandUi)

Here, we see that there are no `bug` attribute in the task `New Burger Recipes`.

### Execute command

This command allows for the running of a `command` on a piped string.

**Format:** `<INPUT> | e`

**Example:**

- `Who lives in a pineapple under the sea | e`

### Replace command

This command replaces a piece of text with another piece of text.

**Format:** `r <TEXT TO REPLACE> <TEXT TO BE REPLACED>`

**Example:**

- `r tetss te%ssts`

### Foreach command

Iterations can increase our workflow efficiency several fold, and through the `foreach` command, we can now cycle
through all entries of an item type in the current scope and apply a command to them. This can be especially powerful
when combined with piping to do complex executions with a single command!

**Format:** `<ITEM> foreach <COMMAND>`

**Example:**

- `task foreach unmark`

![Foreach command ui](images/ForeachCommandUi)

### If / else command

This command behaves exactly like if else statements in programming languages. If the `CRITERIA` specified is met,
then the command sequence will execute `COMMAND IF`, else it will execute `COMMAND ELSE` instead. The command
ensures that the application cannot run `COMMAND IF` and `COMMAND ELSE` in the same command sequence.

>**Note:** If else commands cannot be nested in other if else commands directly.


**Format:** `if [[CRITERIA]] ;; [[COMMAND IF]] ;; [[COMMAND ELSE]]`

**Example:**

- `task select 1 if [[contains bug]] ;; [[mark]] ;; [[task delete]]`

### Aliasing

Aliasing is very useful to have in case you do not agree with the default naming scheme in Contactmation! Here’s
how it works:

**Format:** `alias <NEW COMMAND NAME> <COMMAND>`

**Example:**

- `alias group team`

After running `alias group team`, you are now able to use the command `group` as if it was a `team`!

![Aliasing command ui](images/AliasingCommandUi)

### Custom command / Macro

Do you ever feel tired from typing the same commands over and over again? Do you find yourself highlighting your
commands and copying and pasting them? Macros are available in our application to solve this problem of yours.

All you have to do is assign the command sequence to a single word, or multiple words separated by hyphens and
underscores only. After that, when the word is typed into the command box, the command sequence it is used to
represent will run!

**Format:** `macro <MACRO WORD> <COMMAND SEQUENCE>`

**Example:**

- `macro markeverytask task foreach mark`

This will produce the following output:

![Custom command ui 1](images/CustomCommandUi1)

When `markeverytask` is typed into the command box, all tasks become marked!

![Custom command ui 2](images/CustomCommandUi2)

### Piecing multiple commands together

Here’s another example. You have just completed fixed a bunch of bugs you would like to mark off all tasks that
was bugged as complete.

![Multiple commands ui](images/MultipleCommandsUi)

Well, you know that you defined your custom field’s type as `bug` and you can see that task 1, 2 and 3 are bug
related tasks with the `Severity` labelled as a custom field in the bugs.

Well, you could of course just do `mark` commands 3 times and mark all the tasks, but what if there are a few
hundred of those pesky bug tasks that you and your team fixed?

Luckily for you, Contactmation supports the automation of commands!

Here is an example of a command sequence to search through all tasks and mark all tasks which have bug severity
ratings:

`task foreach if [[contains bug]] ;; [[mark]]`

Using just 1 command sequence, you are able to do the work that many normal commands would similarly achieve and
mark hundreds of tasks in a matter of seconds!

## **FAQ**

> How can I install `Java 11`?

Follow the guide for installing `Java 11` [here](#prerequisites).

> Will this application also apply to a general, non-professional user?

This depends on what you will be using Contactmation for. It still can be used simply as an application
for simply saving and organizing contacts.

## **Future plans**

Our future plans for Contactmation includes:

- The ability to delegate tasks to individuals.
- Contacting any person through the application simply by clicking their email, phone number
  etc.
- Releasing a version of Contactmation on the mobile platform.
- The ability to synchronize data between multiple copies of Contactmation on your mobile and desktop.
- A pop-up window that shows the detailed form of descriptions to the user.
- A for loop command to iterate through and count groups, contacts or tasks by their attribute.
