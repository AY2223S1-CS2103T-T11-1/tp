### Project: Contactmation

Contactmation is a powerful **desktop based team management solution** that **helps its users efficiently and
effectively manage many projects and groups at once.**

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add/delete teams.
    * What it does: allows the user to add teams in Contactmation. Preceding add commands can be reversed by using the 
  delete command.
    * Justification: This feature covers the basic functionality of the product.
    * Highlights: This feature was utilised for other components of Contactmation such as Tasks and Contacts.
    

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link]()

* **Project management**:
    * Managed releases `v1.3` - `v1.5rc` (3 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Updated the GUI color scheme (Pull requests [\#33](), [\#34]())
    * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 88% to 92% (Pull requests [\#36](), [\#38]())

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Added documentation for the features `delete` and `find` [\#72]()
        * Did cosmetic tweaks to existing documentation of features `clear`, `exit`: [\#74]()
    * Developer Guide:
        * Added implementation details of the `delete` feature.

* **Community**:
    * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): [\#12](), [\#32](), [\#19](), [\#42]()
    * Contributed to forum discussions (examples: [1](), [2](), [3](), [4]())
    * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](), [2](), [3]())
    * Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates ([1](), [2]())

* **Tools**:
    * Integrated a third party library (Natty) to the project ([\#42]())
    * Integrated a new Github plugin (CircleCI) to the team repo
