### Project: Contactmation

Contactmation is a desktop project, employee and task management solution.

### Draft and program the storage components in the AddressBook.

- Created `JsonAdaptedPerson`, `JsonAdaptedTask` and `JsonAdaptedGroup` along with
  `JsonAdaptedAbstractDisplayItem` to make sure that the storage of all `model` components
  is easily extensible should the AddressBook expands in the future.

- Saved states of all additional attributes of each `Person`, `Task` and `Group`,
  which includes the `Field`, `Tag`, `CustomCommand`, macros and aliases.

- Saved states of scoping between groups, tasks and persons.

- Updated the introduction, about and advanced feature sections of the user guide.

- Testing for the storage classes.
